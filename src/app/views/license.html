<p>Our Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by CardiaCare (collectively, the "Service")  project with respect to your access and use of the website at cardiacare.ru or  mobile application CardiaCare. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated and notifying you via the Service. Your privacy is important to us, so we encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide to us or is collected about you will be used.<p>

<p>We're constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated and notifying you via the Service, email or some other means. Please note that if you've opted not to receive emails from us, any changes to this policy that you would otherwise have been notified of through email will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.<p>

<h2>What Information does this Policy Cover?</h2>

<p>As used in this Policy, the term "Personal Information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such a name, user name or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include anonymous information, nor does it include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of anonymous or aggregate information.<p>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.<p>
<p>Login to the service provides your account credentials to us. We use it to collect Personal Information such as your name and email address. This data is used to take advantage of some of our features like data storing.

<h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2>

<p>When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, mobile phone type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of the Service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "Cookies". "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device (small data files stored on your hard drive) that allow us to recognise your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited. Among other things, cookies help us improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some or all of our features made available via the Service. We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. We may store and process personal information in the Russian Federation and other countries.<p>

<p><h2>Information Collected Via Other Services and Do Not Track Policy</h2>


<p>Your browser or device may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioural advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked. This is just our Do Not Track policy, and we can't and don't make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your browser.<p>
